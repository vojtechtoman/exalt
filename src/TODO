TODO list (from the present to the past):
=========================================

OK - An error in XmlAdaptiveModel decoding part that is caused by FINISH_ELEMENT_START
OK - Maybe it's useless to encode base identifier of doctype, entities or notations?
 (NOTE: Base identifier not encoded)
   - Length of entity value is limited to XML_MODEL_BUFFER_DEFAULT_SIZE
OK - Auto deletion of ruleset causes problems.
OK - Ensure correct run when CDATA (plus maybe other things) exceed the xmlDataBuff
OK - Use IDs is old variables
 (NOTE: Sequential algorithm implemented)
OK - Encoding the grammar according to KY
OK - Check the error in KY (FORCE RR1)
 (NOTE: Was my mistake...)
OK - Some variables are missing in the terminal digrams
